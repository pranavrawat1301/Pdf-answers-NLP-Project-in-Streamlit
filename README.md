# Pdf Q&A NLP Project

This Streamlit app is designed for PDF Question Answering. Users can upload a PDF file, and the app extracts text from the PDF. Users can then type questions related to the PDF content, and the app uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform question-answering, providing the answer to the asked question.

Here's a brief summary of the code:
1. The app uses Streamlit to create a simple user interface with file uploading and question input components.
2. PyMuPDF (fitz) is used to extract text from the uploaded PDF file.
3. The Hugging Face Transformers library is employed to set up a pre-trained question-answering model.
4. The app displays the extracted PDF content, allows users to input questions, and provides answers based on the content of the PDF.

We can improve the results and make the model more accurate by :

Improving the accuracy of a question-answering model involves several strategies. Here are some suggestions to enhance the accuracy of the Hugging Face Transformers question-answering model used in your Streamlit app:

1. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained model on a domain-specific dataset related to the content of your PDFs. This helps the model adapt to the specific language and topics of your documents.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Experiment with different pre-trained models available in Hugging Face's Transformers library. Some models might be better suited for certain types of documents or questions. Try models like BERT(distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad and bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad), RoBERTa, or other domain-specific models.

3. **Domain-specific Embeddings:**
   - If possible, integrate domain-specific word embeddings or embeddings trained on a relevant corpus. This can enhance the model's understanding of domain-specific terminology.
